Binaural Beamformer: An early Proof of Concept for Wearable Audio Devices <br>
St√©phane D.  March, 2024.

Binaural Beamforming, using signals from microphone
arrays from both ears and respecting 3D localization, is
a promising approach to improve speech intelligibility in
the presence of interfering sound sources for all wearable
audio devices. Despite the imposed small size of
the microphone arrays, it offers strong interfering noise
reduction potential due to the large inter-array distance
and the natural attenuation provided by the head.
